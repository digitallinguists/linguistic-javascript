# Bibliography Display on Websites

## Possible workflow

* load bibliography file (by source specification) into object
* add specific output possibilities
  - inline quoting (specific entry, specific styling, etc.)
  - printing bibliography (all entries, filter entries, per entry)

General goal is to create some JS package that is similar in power with bibtex in Latex documents.
